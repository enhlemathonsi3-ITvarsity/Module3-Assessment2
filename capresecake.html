                <p><i>  Also known as Torta Caprese, this cake is named for the Island of Capri, which is where it is said to have originated. While many variants exist, at its essence it is a chocolate cake made with finely ground nuts, sugar, and eggs. Somewhere between a souffle and a flourless chocolate cake in terms of texture, this cake is out of this world delicious.</i></p>
